**Launch / Stop Button**: launches or stops the Appium server<br />
**App Path**: the path to the iOS application (.app,.zip, or.ipa) or Android application (.apk) you wish to test.

part of the capabilities object when you connect.<br />
**Choose Button**: used to choose the path to your application<br />
**Clear Button**: clears the display of all log data<br/>

### iOS Tab

**UDID**: this is the UDID for the mobile device on which you want to run Appium. If this box is checked, Appium will
use the attached ios device. If this field is checked, bundle ID must be supplied and app path should be unchecked.<br />
**BundleID**: the bundle ID for the application you wish Appium to use (e.g. com.yourCompany.yourApp)<br />
**Force Device**: this will tell Appium to force the simulator to iPhone or iPad mode<br />

BundleID or App Path should both be unchecked when this option is used.<br />
